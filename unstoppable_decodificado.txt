There's a moment in your bones when, when the fire takes over
Blood is running, heart is pumping as the battle gets closer

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
They could say what they want now
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
'Cause we'll be screaming out

We can be heroes everywhere we go
We can have all that we ever want
Swinging like Ali, knocking out bodies
Standing on top like a champion
Keep your silver, give me that gold
You remember when I say
We can be heroes everywhere we go 
Keeping us down is impossible
'Cause we're unstoppable

Oh woah, we're unstoppable
Oh woah, we're unstoppable

Every spotlight, every sound bite
Everybody who gave up
Is just a fool for wanting it more than anybody against us

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
They could say what they want now
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
'Cause we'll be screaming out

We can be heroes everywhere we go
We can have all that we ever want
Swinging like Ali, knocking out bodies
Standing on top like a champion
Keep your silver, give me that gold
You remember when I say
We can be heroes everywhere we go
Keeping us down is impossible
'Cause we're unstoppable

Oh woah, we're unstoppable
Oh woah, we're unstoppable

They can say what they want now (oh)
'Cause we'll be screaming out
(Ooh ooh)

We can be heroes everywhere we go
We can have all that we ever want
Swinging like Ali, knocking out bodies
Standing on top like a champion
Keep your silver, give me that gold
You remember when I say
We can be heroes everywhere we go
Keeping us down is impossible
'Cause we're unstoppable

Oh woah, we're unstoppable
Oh woah, we're unstoppable
Oh woah, we're unstoppable
Oh woah, we're unstoppable
Oh woah, we're unstoppable
We're unstoppable
